This project was created to showcase my proficiency in using SQL to explore data from public dataset in [data.world](https://data.world/jamesgaskin/movies).\
The project involves querying the database to retrieve specific information, aggregating data to calculate statistics. Overall, the goal of the project is to gain a better understanding of the movies dataset and to use that understanding to make further decision.\

By analyzing this database, we will be able to answer various questions related to movies, such as:
- What are the top-rated movies of all time?
- What are the most popular movie genres?
- What are the most successful movies in a particular year?
- What is the average runtime for all movies?
- Who has participated in the most movie? and what are that movies? 

SQL skills used:
- Aggregate functions
- JOIN
- Subqueries
- Windows function
